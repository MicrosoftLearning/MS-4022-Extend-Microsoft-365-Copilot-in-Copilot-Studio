# Add suggested prompts

In this exercise, you will update the declarative agent you created in the previous exercise with six suggested prompts.

This exercise should take approximately **10** minutes to complete.

## Define suggested prompts

In Copilot Studio:

1. Navigate to your **Product Support** agent's **Overview** page.
1. In the **Suggested Prompts** section, select **Add suggested prompts**.
1. Add the following prompts:

      | Title                  | Prompt                                              |
      |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
      | Product information    | Tell me about Eagle Air                          |
      | Returns policy         | What is the returns policy?                      |
      | Product information    | Can you provide information on a specific product? |
      | Product troubleshooting| I'm having trouble with a product. Can you help me troubleshoot the issue? |
      | Repair information     | Can you provide information on how to get a product repaired? |
      | Contact support        | How can I contact support for help?              |

1. **Save** your changes.

## Republish your agent

Let's publish the updated agent to Microsoft 365 Copilot.

1. Select **Publish** at the top-right of your agent's overview page in Copilot Studio.
1. On the modal window that opens, select **Publish**.
1. On the **Availability options** window that opens, select **Copy** under the **Share link** heading.
1. In a different tab of your web browser, **paste** your agent's share link and select **enter**. A window appears describing the **Product Support** agent.
1. Select **Update now** under the agent's name to publish the changes to the Product Support agent. Wait a few moments while the agent is updated.
1. When the update is complete, close the modal window. If you're not taken to Microsoft 365 Copilot in your browser, select **Copilot** from the left-hand menu or the **Apps** menu in the Microsoft 365 portal.

## Test your agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot

1. In **Microsoft 365 Copilot**, select the icon in the top right to expand the **Copilot side panel**.
1. Find **Product support** in the list of agents and select it to enter the immersive experience to chat directly with the agent. Notice that the suggested prompts you defined in Copilot Studio display in the user interface.
