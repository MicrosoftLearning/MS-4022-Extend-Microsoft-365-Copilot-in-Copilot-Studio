# Add starter prompts <!-- match title in metadata above (and Learn Exercise unit and ILT slide)-->

In this exercise you will update the declarative agent you created in the previous exercise with six starter prompts.

This exercise should take approximately **10** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

<!--
Add steps to get the learner to the starting point" for the exercise.
This might be cloning the repo and running a script or performing some manual steps.
Only include this section if its necessary to do some pre-exercise setup AND the same setup steps are required for self-paced (on Learn) and managed (in hosted ILT lab profiles) scenarios. Otherwise delete this section.
If self-paced /ILT-specific setup steps are required, include them in the Learn "Exercise" unit from where they open this exercise and in the Skillable lab profile instructions before this markdown file is imported.

## Define starter prompts

In Copilot Studio:

1. Navigate to your **Product Support** agent's **Overview** page.
1. In the **Starter Prompts** section, select **Edit**.
1. Add the following six starter prompts:

      | Title                  | Text                                              |
      |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
      | Product information    | Tell me about Eagle Air                          |
      | Returns policy         | What is the returns policy?                      |
      | Product information    | Can you provide information on a specific product? |
      | Product troubleshooting| I'm having trouble with a product. Can you help me troubleshoot the issue? |
      | Repair information     | Can you provide information on how to get a product repaired? |
      | Contact support        | How can I contact support for help?              |

1. **Save** your changes.

## Task 2: Publish and test your agent

Next, test your declarative agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot and validate the results.
